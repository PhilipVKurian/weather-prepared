Weather Prepared
The project involves the implementaion of Bulma css, javascript/jQuery, and 2 different APIs (openweathermap and weatherbit.io) to predict clothing
the user should need for their next day of work. Or in the event of a storm, what precautions they must take.

SO THAT I can be well dressed and prepared for unpredictable weather.
